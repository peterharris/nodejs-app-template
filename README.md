#Node.js App Starter Template

This template gets you started building a node.js app with Express, Mongoose, and Jade, with Twitter Bootstrap for styling. It includes a model for Mongodb, as well as some of the starter html with Bootstrap.

It uses some of the code from [Ben Edmunds' Node Express MVR Example](https://github.com/benedmunds/Node-Express-MVR-Example).
